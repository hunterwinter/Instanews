## Reflections

This project was a great utilization of jquery, as this project was this first that I've really dug deep into it, 
and also was the first time I've pulled an API using an AJAX request. This project was also the first time I've used SASS,
and I have to say that I love it. The fact that you can make variables and imports to keep your code organized makes writing
the styling a dream!
